# Memento Blogs

The very first post!

I will work on a format for these blogs and a more standardised system to implement here, but for now, this will do.

## First Steps

*by mikanwolfe*

Memento as a concept is vague right now, no doubt.

The origin of memento started as a discussion between dondarion and I about game development when 2B asked about how games were made. The resulting discussion eventually came to become the concept of *Memento*, though lead by me exclusively. 

During the next few weeks almost nothing happened, and for good reason. We weren't paricularly organised and we didn't have a good idea of what to do. 

More to come, but for now, this will be enough of an except to justify a page.
