# Project Memento

Memento will be the project name for a series of games written by Mikan (Mikanwolfe), Dondarion, and B1_347.
We wanted to learn something in our spare time and after some discussion we thought this would be interesting.

The goals for this project is simple:
* Learn about programming in a more practical environment (not in the lab-like conditions at university);
* Learn how to use Github, Markdown, and other development tools;
* ...
* and learn to work together as a group. Properly. Not like groupwork at uni.

Forgive us for our sins for we are absolute beginners in both using GitHub, Git, and even Markdown.

Re: resources used for GODOT development.
I don't actually like to use online/easily accessible assets for development, so there will probably be a lot of my own itty-bitty artworks here. You're welcome to use any assets provided here that have been made by me without permission (written or otherwise) unless stated otherwise, in which case, I ask that you provide a link to [my pixiv account](https://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=13646231).
